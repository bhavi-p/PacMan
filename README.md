# PacMen
## Factory for making pacmen
At the click of a button, generate as many PacMen as you'd like that will get added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each one.
When you click start, the PacMen are animated and moving around the window via DOM manipulation and changing direction when they bounce off the wall

## How To Run
Follow the link to this repo to check it out on Github Pages
Clone the project and run index.html

## Roadmap of Future
I would like to make the UI more game like and add stylized buttons and maybe more options for the user to manipulate the game
